.SH NAME
_printf - format and print data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.br
.PP
Function built
as a limited implementation
based on
.IR printf()
subroutine available in the
.IR <stdio.h>
header of ANSI C standard library.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR _printf()
takes the arguments and format the output accordingly into
.IR stdout ,
the standard output stream.
.PP
This function writes the output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.SS Return value
If the program ran correctly, the return corresponds to the number of characters
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
characters (not
.BR % ),
which are copied unchanged to the output stream;
and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or
more subsequent arguments.
Each conversion specification is introduced by
the character
.BR % ,
and ends with a
.IR "conversion specifier" .

.SS The conversion specifier
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR d ", " i
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
The default precision is 1.

.TP
.BR b ", " o ", " u ", " x ", " X
The
.I "unsigned int"
argument is converted to unsigned binary
.RB ( b ),
unsigned octal
.RB ( o ),
unsigned decimal
.RB ( u ),
or unsigned hexadecimal
.RB ( x
and
.BR X )
notation.
The letters
.B abcdef
(lowercase)
are used for
.B x
conversions; the letters
.B ABCDEF
(uppercase)
are used for
.B X
conversions.
The default precision is 1.
When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.TP
.BR r ", " R
The
.I "character string"
argument is printed in reverse
.RB ( r )
and
traslate into rot13 cypher
.RB ( R )
.

.SH EXAMPLE
To print an
.I character string
:
.in +4n
.nf

_printf("%s", "Holberton School rocks!");
.fi
.in
.PP
To print the
.I hexadecimal
number of an integer:
.in +4n
.nf

_printf("%X", 402930);
.fi
.in
.PP
To print a combination of
.I character
,
.I "character string"
,
and
.I integers
:
.in +4n
.nf

_printf("My %s has still %d %s%c", "cat", 7, "live", 's');

.fi
